# SP500-Data-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning
Thank you to Harrison at ProgrammingPython.net for his help in creating this program.
For this project I pulled stock data off of Morningstar's website and built a program to leverage and analyze the correlation betweenstocks to be used in a simple machine learning algorithm.
NOTE: Stock data from Morningstar did not include adjusted close data. I used close data for this analysis so the accuracy of results is negatively affected because close data does not account for stock splits and dividends. However, given proper data, this algorithm works well and can be used to gain a slight edge on the market.
